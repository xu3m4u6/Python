# Password Checker

By running this script, you can check whether your passwords have been leaked. I use the API from https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3.


When you run the script in terminal, add all the passwords you want to check at the end of the command and separate with a blank space. 


For example: -> Python3 checkmypass.py password1 password2
