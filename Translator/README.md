# Translator


I build a tool that allows us to run a command through a file, read it and then translate the content into Japanese.


I try two kinds of translating packages:

Package 1: translate

It is an offline translate module, you can try it with translator.py


Package 2: googletrans

It is a translating module that uses Google translate API, you can try it with translator1.py
